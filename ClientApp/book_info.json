One hundred thirteen years later, two backcountry guides are hired by a history professor and his journalist daughter to lead them into the abandoned mining town, so they can learn what happened. With them is a psychic and a paranormal photographer, as the town is rumored to be haunted. A party that tried to explore the town years ago was never heard from again. What this crew is about to discover is that twenty miles from civilization, with a blizzard bearing down, they are not alone, and the past is very much alive.","authors":{"author":{"id":"442240","name":"Blake Crouch","role":"","image_url":{"@nophoto":"false","#cdata-section":"https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1479398727p5/442240.jpg"},"small_image_url":{"@nophoto":"false","#cdata-section":"https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1479398727p2/442240.jpg"},"link":{"#cdata-section":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/442240.Blake_Crouch"},"average_rating":"3.99","ratings_count":"268649","text_reviews_count":"28404"}},"published":"2009","work":{"id":"6225216"}}},{"book":{"id":{"@type":"integer","#text":"35690861"},"isbn":{"@nil":"true"},"isbn13":{"@nil":"true"},"text_reviews_count":{"@type":"integer","#text":"6"},"title":"Skin & Earth #2","title_without_series":"Skin & Earth #2","image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png","small_image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png","large_image_url":null,"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35690861-skin-earth-2","num_pages":"","format":"","edition_information":null,"publisher":"","publication_day":"","publication_year":"","publication_month":"","average_rating":"4.56","ratings_count":"43","description":"","authors":{"author":{"id":"5090594","name":"Lights","role":"","image_url":{"@nophoto":"true","#cdata-section":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"},"small_image_url":{"@nophoto":"true","#cdata-section":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png"},"link":{"#cdata-section":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5090594.Lights"},"average_rating":"4.48","ratings_count":"116","text_reviews_count":"23"}},"published":"","work":{"id":"57175990"}}},{"book":{"id":{"@type":"integer","#text":"136251"},"isbn":"0545010225","isbn13":"9780545010221","text_reviews_count":{"@type":"integer","#text":"45132"},"title":"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Harry Potter, #7)","title_without_series":"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1474171184m/136251.jpg","small_image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1474171184s/136251.jpg","large_image_url":null,"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/136251.Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows","num_pages":"759","format":"","edition_information":"First American Edition","publisher":"Arthur A.

Professor Dumbledore has given them clues about what they need to do to defeat the dark wizard, Lord Voldemort, once and for all, but it's up to them to figure out what these hints and suggestions really mean.<br /><br />Their cross-country odyssey has them searching desperately for the answers, while evading capture or death at every turn.

Ron scans the obituary pages of The Daily Prophet looking for familiar names. Dumbledore is absent from Hogwarts for long stretches of time, and the Order of the Phoenix has already suffered losses. And yet... As in all wars, life goes on. Sixth-year students learn to Apparate, and lose a few eyebrows in the process. The Weasley twins expand their business.

Harry struggles to uncover the identity of the Half-Blood Prince, the past owner of a potions textbook he now possesses that is filled with ingenious, potentially deadly, spells. But Harry's life is suddenly changed forever when someone close to him is heinously murdered right before his eyes.

He wants to get away from the malicious Dursleys and go to the Quidditch World Cup with Hermione, Ron, and the Weasleys. He wants to dream about his crush, Cho Chang (and maybe do more than dream).<br />And now that heâ€™s gotten the hang of things at Hogwartsâ€”he hopesâ€”he just wants to be a normal fourteen-year-old wizard.<br /><br />But even by his standards, Harry's year is anything but normal. First Dumbledore announces the revival of a grand competition that hasn't taken place for one hundred years: the Triwizard Tournament, where a Hogwarts champion will compete against rivals from two other schools of magic in three highly dangerous tasks. Then someone frames Harry to participate in the tournamentâ€”which really means someone wants him dead.<br /><br />Harry is guided through the competition by Professor Alastor Moody, this year's Defenst Against the Dark Arts teacher, but he must also contend with a nasty reporter named Rita Skeeter, who digs up some highly unflattering secrets about Hagrid; a terrible fight with Ron, who is deeply jealous of Harry's fame; Hermione's newfound activism on behalf of house-elves; and the terrifying prospect of asking a date to the Yule Ball.<br /><br />Worst of all, Lord Voldemort may finally have gathered the materials necessary for his rejuvenation... and he has a faithful servant at Hogwarts waiting only for a sign. No, nothing is every normal for Harry Potter. And in his case, different can be deadly.<br />--harrypotter.scholastic.com","authors":{"author":{"id":"1077326","name":"J.K.

A convicted murderer, Sirius Black, has broken out of Azkaban prison, and it seems he's after Harry. Now Hogwarts is being patrolled by the dementors, the Azkaban guards who are hunting Sirius. But Harry can't imagine that Sirius or, for that matter, the evil Lord Voldemort could be more frightening than the dementors themselves, who have the terrible power to fill anyone they come across with aching loneliness and despair. Meanwhile, life continues as usual at Hogwarts. A top-of-the-line broom takes Harry's success at Quidditch, the sport of the Wizarding world, to new heights. A cute fourth-year student catches his eye. And he becomes close with the new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher, who was a childhood friend of his father. Yet despite the relative safety of life at Hogwarts and the best efforts of the dementors, the threat of Sirius Black grows ever closer. But if Harry has learned anything from his education in wizardry, it is that things are often not what they seem. Tragic revelations, heartwarming surprises, and high-stakes magical adventures await the boy wizard in this funny and poignant third installment of the beloved series.<br />--scholastic.com","authors":{"author":{"id":"1077326","name":"J.K.

Â From the waning days of the 20th centuryâ€™s final great war to the fraught fields of Afghanistan to the otherworldly secrets hidden amid Nevadaâ€™s dusty neverlandsâ€”the truth that is out there will propel each of them into a labyrinth of otherworldly technology and the competing aims of those who might seek to preventâ€”or harnessâ€”these beings of unfathomable power. Â Because, as it turns out, we are not the only ones who can invent and buildâ€¦and destroy.

But the dark side of rock stardom took its toll: his marriage, chronicled for an MTV reality show, fell apart. Constant touring concealed a serious drug addiction. A reckoning did not truly come until he was forced to face mortality: His life nearly ended in a horrifying plane crash, and then his close friend, collaborator, and fellow crash survivor DJ AM died of an overdose.<br /><br />In this blunt, driving memoir, Barker ruminates on rock stardom, fatherhood, death, loss, and redemption, sharing stories shaped by decadesâ€™ worth of hard-earned insights. His pulsating memoir is as energetic as his acclaimed beats. It brings to a close the first chapters of a well-lived life, inspiring readers to follow the rhythms of their own hearts and find meaning in their lives.","authors":{"author":{"id":"7273679","name":"Travis Barker","role":"","image_url":{"@nophoto":"false","#cdata-section":"https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1447886866p5/7273679.jpg"},"small_image_url":{"@nophoto":"false","#cdata-section":"https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1447886866p2/7273679.jpg"},"link":{"#cdata-section":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7273679.Travis_Barker"},"average_rating":"4.28","ratings_count":"1661","text_reviews_count":"161"}},"published":"2015","work":{"id":"26366065"}}},{"book":{"id":{"@type":"integer","#text":"32692"},"isbn":"0831727527","isbn13":"9780831727529","text_reviews_count":{"@type":"integer","#text":"1857"},"title":"Gerald's Game","title_without_series":"Gerald's Game","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1297737756m/32692.jpg","small_image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1297737756s/32692.jpg","large_image_url":null,"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32692.Gerald_s_Game","num_pages":"332","format":"Hardcover","edition_information":null,"publisher":"Smithmark Publishers","publication_day":"1","publication_year":"1992","publication_month":"9","average_rating":"3.47","ratings_count":"106017","description":"Gerald and Jessie Burlingame have gone to their summer home on a warm weekday in October for a romantic getaway.

As their stable home devolves into a house of horrors, they reluctantly turn to a local Catholic priest for help. Father Wanderly suggests an exorcism; he believes the vulnerable teenager is the victim of demonic possession. He also contacts a production company that is eager to document the Barretts' plight. With John, Marjorie's father, out of work for more than a year and the medical bills looming, the family agrees to be filmed, and soon find themselves the unwitting stars of The Possession, a hit reality television show. When events in the Barrett household explode in tragedy, the show and the shocking incidents it captures become the stuff of urban legend.<br /><br />Fifteen years later, a bestselling writer interviews Marjorie's younger sister, Merry. As she recalls those long ago events that took place when she was just eight years old, long-buried secrets and painful memories that clash with what was broadcast on television begin to surface--and a mind-bending tale of psychological horror is unleashed, raising vexing questions about memory and reality, science and religion, and the very nature of evil.","authors":{"author":{"id":"648612","name":"Paul Tremblay","role":"","image_url":{"@nophoto":"false","#cdata-section":"https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1415058580p5/648612.jpg"},"small_image_url":{"@nophoto":"false","#cdata-section":"https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1415058580p2/648612.jpg"},"link":{"#cdata-section":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/648612.Paul_Tremblay"},"average_rating":"3.78","ratings_count":"25404","text_reviews_count":"4381"}},"published":"2015","work":{"id":"42563937"}}},{"book":{"id":{"@type":"integer","#text":"25526965"},"isbn":"1501129740","isbn13":"9781501129742","text_reviews_count":{"@type":"integer","#text":"4214"},"title":"End of Watch (Bill Hodges Trilogy, #3)","title_without_series":"End of Watch","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1468705472m/25526965.jpg","small_image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1468705472s/25526965.jpg","large_image_url":null,"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25526965-end-of-watch","num_pages":"432","format":"Hardcover","edition_information":null,"publisher":"Scribner","publication_day":"7","publication_year":"2016","publication_month":"6","average_rating":"4.09","ratings_count":"46087","description":"The spectacular finale to the New York Times bestselling trilogy that began with Mr. Mercedes (winner of the Edgar Award) and Finders Keepersâ€”In End of Watch, the diabolical â€œMercedes Killerâ€ drives his enemies to suicide, and if Bill Hodges and Holly Gibney donâ€™t figure out a way to stop him, theyâ€™ll be victims themselves.<br /><br />In Room 217 of the Lakes Region Traumatic Brain Injury Clinic, something has awakened. Something evil. Brady Hartsfield, perpetrator of the Mercedes Massacre, where eight people were killed and many more were badly injured, has been in the clinic for five years, in a vegetative state. According to his doctors, anything approaching a complete recovery is unlikely. But behind the drool and stare, Brady is awake, and in possession of deadly new powers that allow him to wreak unimaginable havoc without ever leaving his hospital room.<br /><br />Retired police detective Bill Hodges, the unlikely hero of Mr. Mercedes and Finders Keepers, now runs an investigation agency with his partner, Holly Gibneyâ€”the woman who delivered the blow to Hartsfieldâ€™s head that put him on the brain injury ward. When Bill and Holly are called to a suicide scene with ties to the Mercedes Massacre, they find themselves pulled into their most dangerous case yet, one that will put their lives at risk, as well as those of Billâ€™s heroic young friend Jerome Robinson and his teenage sister, Barbara. Brady Hartsfield is back, and planning revenge not just on Hodges and his friends, but on an entire city.<br /><br />In End of Watch, Stephen King brings the Hodges trilogy to a sublimely terrifying conclusion, combining the detective fiction of Mr. Mercedes and Finders Keepers with the heart-pounding, supernatural suspense that has been his bestselling trademark. The result is an unnerving look at human vulnerability and chilling suspense.

The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.<br /><br />But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.<br /><br />~from author's web site","authors":{"author":{"id":"589","name":"Orson Scott Card","role":"","image_url":{"@nophoto":"false","#cdata-section":"https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1294099952p5/589.jpg"},"small_image_url":{"@nophoto":"false","#cdata-section":"https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1294099952p2/589.jpg"},"link":{"#cdata-section":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/589.Orson_Scott_Card"},"average_rating":"4.07","ratings_count":"2157348","text_reviews_count":"92234"}},"published":"1994","work":{"id":"2422333"}}},{"book":{"id":{"@type":"integer","#text":"259127"},"isbn":"0641589948","isbn13":{"@nil":"true"},"text_reviews_count":{"@type":"integer","#text":"53"},"title":"The Alchemist","title_without_series":"The Alchemist","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1305036445m/259127.jpg","small_image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1305036445s/259127.jpg","large_image_url":null,"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/259127.The_Alchemist","num_pages":"234","format":"Paperback","edition_information":null,"publisher":"Ballantine","publication_day":null,"publication_year":"2002","publication_month":null,"average_rating":"3.53","ratings_count":"480","description":"In a sweeping epic of dazzling magic, soaring suspense, and dark longing, three immortal souls are united by fate and a fearless ambition that will change the course of historyâ€“even as it destroys their own way of life. . . . <br />On an upper floor of a plush, high-security building on Central Park West, an elegant man sits in the office of Dr. Anne Kramer, confessing to the heinous murder that has horrified the modern world. Randolf Sontime is renowned for his personal charm, and Dr. Kramer is fighting to keep from falling victim to it. For the first time in her life, she truly understands the meaning of the word â€œcharisma.â€ Not knowing that her own destiny is irrevocably tied to his, Anne Kramer listens to the story of Sontimeâ€™s life.<br /><br /><i>â€œIt began with the magic, you see. And so, perforce, must I.â€ </i>As a boy named Han at the House of Ra, an isolated oasis in the Egyptian desert of a far ancient time, Sontime lived in privilege. There the chosen were trained in the science of alchemyâ€“magic, philosophy, miracles. Only two other initiates were as skilled as he: Akan, quiet and studious, a boy whose thirst for knowledge was matched only by his hunger for truth; and Nefar, beautiful and brilliant, a girl as filled with wonder and unfathomable ambition as Han himself. Together they discovered that in union, theirs was a power unmatched in the physical world.<br /><br />But even in the House of Ra, there were boundaries to be observed, knowledge that only the masters understood and feared. As the threesomeâ€™s thirst for answersâ€“and for each otherâ€“deepened, they were tempted by the dark arts that they had sworn to avoid. <i>â€œLook at three magnificent youths who stand astride your world and scoff at the rules you must obey. . . .

Why are we here? Why is there something rather than nothing? What is the nature of reality? Why are the laws of nature so finely tuned as to allow for the existence of beings like ourselves? And, finally, is the apparent â€œgrand designâ€ of our universe evidence of a benevolent creator who set things in motionâ€”or does science offer another explanation? <br /><br />The most fundamental questions about the origins of the universe and of life itself, once the province of philosophy, now occupy the territory where scientists, philosophers, and theologians meetâ€”if only to disagree. In their new book, Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow present the most recent scientific thinking about the mysteries of the universe, in nontechnical language marked by both brilliance and simplicity. <br /><br />In <i>The Grand Design</i> they explain that according to quantum theory, the cosmos does not have just a single existence or history, but rather that every possible history of the universe exists simultaneously. When applied to the universe as a whole, this idea calls into question the very notion of cause and effect. But the â€œtop-downâ€ approach to cosmology that Hawking and <br /><br />Mlodinow describe would say that the fact that the past takes no definite form means that we create history by observing it, rather than that history creates us. The authors further explain that we ourselves are the product of quantum fluctuations in the very early universe, and show how quantum theory predicts the â€œmultiverseâ€â€”the idea that ours is just one of many universes that appeared spontaneously out of nothing, each with different laws of nature.<br /><br />Along the way Hawking and Mlodinow question the conventional concept of reality, posing a â€œmodel-dependentâ€ theory of reality as the best we can hope to find. And they conclude with a riveting assessment of M-theory, an explanation of the laws governing us and our universe that is currently the only viable candidate for a complete â€œtheory of everything.â€ If confirmed, they write, it will be the unified theory that Einstein was looking for, and the ultimate triumph of human reason.<br /><br />A succinct, startling, and lavishly illustrated guide to discoveries that are altering our understanding and threatening some of our most cherished belief systems, <i>The Grand Design</i> is a book that will informâ€”and provokeâ€”like no other.","authors":{"author":{"id":"1401","name":"Stephen Hawking","role":"","image_url":{"@nophoto":"false","#cdata-section":"https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1197404653p5/1401.jpg"},"small_image_url":{"@nophoto":"false","#cdata-section":"https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1197404653p2/1401.jpg"},"link":{"#cdata-section":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1401.Stephen_Hawking"},"average_rating":"4.10","ratings_count":"336246","text_reviews_count":"11513"}},"published":"2010","work":{"id":"13383926"}}},{"book":{"id":{"@type":"integer","#text":"15814872"},"isbn":"0525953728","isbn13":"9780525953722","text_reviews_count":{"@type":"integer","#text":"3328"},"title":"No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden","title_without_series":"No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1345815909m/15814872.jpg","small_image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1345815909s/15814872.jpg","large_image_url":null,"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15814872-no-easy-day","num_pages":"316","format":"","edition_information":null,"publisher":"","publication_day":"4","publication_year":"2012","publication_month":"9","average_rating":"3.95","ratings_count":"37943","description":"<b>For the first time anywhere, the first-person account of the planning and execution of the Bin Laden raid from a Navy Seal who confronted the terrorist mastermind and witnessed his final moment</b><br /><br />From the streets of Iraq to the rescue of Captain Richard Phillips in the Indian Ocean, and from the mountaintops of Afghanistan to the third floor of Osama Bin Laden's compound, operator Mark Owen of the U.S. Naval Special Warfare Development Group--commonly known as SEAL Team Six--has been a part of some of the most memorable special operations in history, as well as countless missions that never made headlines.<br /><br /><i>No Easy Day</i> puts readers alongside Owen and the other handpicked members of the twenty-four-man team as they train for the biggest mission of their lives.

Owen's story draws on his youth in Alaska and describes the SEALs' quest to challenge themselves at the highest levels of physical and mental endurance. With boots-on-the-ground detail, Owen describes numerous previously unreported missions that illustrate the life and work of a SEAL and the evolution of the team after the events of September 11.

Because I'm tired of a world where blogs take indirect bribes, marketers help write the news, reckless journalists spread lies, and no one is accountable for any of it.

What they weren't expecting, though, was the story that emerged in the months that followed--a story as beautiful as it was extraordinary, detailing their little boy's trip to heaven and back.<br /><br />Colton, not yet four years old, told his parents he left his body during the surgery--and authenticated that claim by describing exactly what his parents were doing in another part of the hospital while he was being operated on. He talked of visiting heaven and relayed stories told to him by people he met there whom he had never met in life, sharing events that happened even before he was born. He also astonished his parents with descriptions and obscure details about heaven that matched the Bible exactly, though he had not yet learned to read.<br /><br />With disarming innocence and the plainspoken boldness of a child, Colton tells of meeting long-departed family members. He describes Jesus, the angels, how \"really, really big\" God is, and how much God loves us. Retold by his father, but using Colton's uniquely simple words, \"Heaven is for Real\" offers a glimpse of the world that awaits us, where as Colton says, \"Nobody is old and nobody wears glasses.\"<br /><br />\"Heaven is for Real\" will forever change the way you think of eternity, offering you the chance to see, and believe, like a child.","authors":{"author":{"id":"3446736","name":"Todd Burpo","role":"","image_url":{"@nophoto":"false","#cdata-section":"https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1407307061p5/3446736.jpg"},"small_image_url":{"@nophoto":"false","#cdata-section":"https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1407307061p2/3446736.jpg"},"link":{"#cdata-section":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3446736.Todd_Burpo"},"average_rating":"4.02","ratings_count":"250214","text_reviews_count":"14919"}},"published":"2010","work":{"id":"11283577"}}},{"book":{"id":{"@type":"integer","#text":"5979072"},"isbn":"038551638X","isbn13":"9780385516389","text_reviews_count":{"@type":"integer","#text":"414"},"title":"A Dark Matter","title_without_series":"A Dark Matter","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320407011m/5979072.jpg","small_image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320407011s/5979072.jpg","large_image_url":null,"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5979072-a-dark-matter","num_pages":"397","format":"Hardcover","edition_information":null,"publisher":"Doubleday","publication_day":"9","publication_year":"2010","publication_month":"2","average_rating":"2.96","ratings_count":"3228","description":"<b>The incomparable master of horror and suspense returns with a powerful, brilliantly terrifying novel that redefines the genre in original and unexpected ways.<br /></b><br />The charismatic and cunning Spenser Mallon is a campus guru in the 1960s, attracting the devotion and demanding sexual favors of his young acolytes.

They look harmless - mostly old, lots of polyester, and married to their RVs.

Finally, he settles in a New Hampshire town, an AA community that sustains him, and a job at a nursing home where his remnant \"shining\" power provides the crucial final comfort to the dying. Aided by a prescient cat, he becomes \"Doctor Sleep.\"<br /><br />Then Dan meets the evanescent Abra Stone, and it is her spectacular gift, the brightest shining ever seen, that reignites Dan's own demons and summons him to a battle for Abra's soul and survival. This is an epic war between good and evil, a gory, glorious story that will thrill the millions of hyper-devoted fans of The Shining and wildly satisfy anyone new to the territory of this icon in the King canon.","authors":{"author":{"id":"3389","name":"Stephen King","role":"","image_url":{"@nophoto":"false","#cdata-section":"https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1362814142p5/3389.jpg"},"small_image_url":{"@nophoto":"false","#cdata-section":"https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1362814142p2/3389.jpg"},"link":{"#cdata-section":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3389.Stephen_King"},"average_rating":"4.01","ratings_count":"10395987","text_reviews_count":"351127"}},"published":"2013","work":{"id":"17851499"}}},{"book":{"id":{"@type":"integer","#text":"960"},"isbn":"1416524797","isbn13":"9781416524793","text_reviews_count":{"@type":"integer","#text":"19467"},"title":"Angels & Demons  (Robert Langdon, #1)","title_without_series":"Angels & Demons","image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1303390735m/960.jpg","small_image_url":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1303390735s/960.jpg","large_image_url":null,"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/960.Angels_Demons","num_pages":"713","format":"Mass Market Paperback","edition_information":"Pocket Books Premium Edition","publisher":"Pocket Books","publication_day":"","publication_year":"","publication_month":"","average_rating":"3.85","ratings_count":"2086045","description":"When world-renowned Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is summoned to a Swiss research facility to analyze a mysterious symbolâ€”seared into the chest of a murdered physicistâ€”he discovers evidence of the unimaginable: the resurgence of an ancient secret brotherhood known as the Illuminati ... the most powerful underground organization ever to walk the earth.

Langdon is instantly into a clandestine world of Masonic secrets, hidden history, and never-before-seen locations - all of which seem to be dragging him toward a single, inconceivable truth.<br /><br />As the world discovered in <i>The Da Vinci Code</i> and <i>Angels &amp; Demons</i>, Dan Brown's novels are brilliant tapestries of veiled histories, arcane symbols, and enigmatic codes. In this new novel, he again challenges readers with an intelligent, lightning-paced story that offers surprises at every turn. <i>The Lost Symbol</i> is exactly what Brown's fans have been waiting for...his most thrilling novel yet.","authors":{"author":{"id":"630","name":"Dan Brown","role":"","image_url":{"@nophoto":"false","#cdata-section":"https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1399396714p5/630.jpg"},"small_image_url":{"@nophoto":"false","#cdata-section":"https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1399396714p2/630.jpg"},"link":{"#cdata-section":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/630.Dan_Brown"},"average_rating":"3.78","ratings_count":"5353923","text_reviews_count":"140729"}},"published":"","work":{"id":"6600281"}}},{"book":{"id":{"@type":"integer","#text":"976"},"isbn":"0671027387","isbn13":"9780671027384","text_reviews_count":{"@type":"integer","#text":"6303"},"title":"Deception Point","title_without_series":"Deception Point","image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png","small_image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png","large_image_url":null,"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/976.Deception_Point","num_pages":"556","format":"Paperback","edition_information":null,"publisher":"Pocket Books","publication_day":"26","publication_year":"2002","publication_month":"11","average_rating":"3.67","ratings_count":"481360","description":"When a new NASA satellite spots evidence of an astonishingly rare object buried deep in the Arctic ice, the floundering space agency proclaims a much-needed victory...a victory that has profound implications for U.S. space policy and the impending presidential election.

A desperate race through the cathedrals and castles of Europe. An astonishing truth concealed for centuries . . . unveiled at last.<br /><br />While in Paris, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is awakened by a phone call in the dead of the night. The elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum, his body covered in baffling symbols. As Langdon and gifted French cryptologist Sophie Neveu sort through the bizarre riddles, they are stunned to discover a trail of clues hidden in the works of Leonardo da Vinciâ€”clues visible for all to see and yet ingeniously disguised by the painter.<br /><br />Even more startling, the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sionâ€”a secret society whose members included Sir Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo, and Da Vinciâ€”and he guarded a breathtaking historical secret.
